# my_hammer_spoon_script
This is a hammer spoon script I'm using myself. It can call many system APIs and complete many automation tasks, including automatically switching input methods and adjusting window positions.

After installing the hammer spoon, follow the prompts to grant the corresponding permissions, and then you can see a hidden folder `.hammerspoon` in the user's home directory and put the script into it. 'init.lua' is required, and the remaining scripts will be called in this script.

My scripts include five documents,`init.lua`,`layout.lua`,`language.lua`,`markdown.lua`,`status-message.lua`. The second script refers to [example of the official website] (http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/); the last three scripts refer to [a great project] (https://github.com/JIagengDing/hammerspoon-config), and he refers to [another great project] (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Q54y197dw).

I have made a lot of changes to the reference code according to my own needs, including fixing some bugs and enhancing code readability. You can also refer to [Official Document] (http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/) to make a script that suits you.
